# Project Description

As a Data Analyst, I have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills.

My first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:

Job postings

Training portals

Surveys

Once I have collected enough data, I will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:

What are the top programming languages in demand?

What are the top database skills in demand?

What are the popular IDEs?

# Introduction

As a Data Analyst, I have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. My first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including: Job postings,Training portals,Surveys.

Once I have collected enough data, I will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends.

# Objective

## Background

Analyzing the trends in software development.

## Purpose

Identify skill requirements for future.

## Question for Analysis

What are the top programming languages in demand?

What are the top database skills in demand?

What are the popular IDEs?

## Audience

Human Resource and IT Head.

# Hardware and Software Requirments

## Hardware

In this Project We are going to use IBM Cloud Pack for Data and its various Web services, so a RAM of 8 GB and decent Internet Connection is required only. All the hardware requirments will be covered by IBM Cloud Pack for Data.

## Software

We are going to use IBM Watson Studio for this project.

In case of local machine We are going to use the following softwares in this project :

Programming Language : [Python](https://www.python.org/)

IDE : [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

Packages : [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Scipy](https://scipy.org/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [BeautifulSoop](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).
